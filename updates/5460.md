__Version ID__: 5460
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- CDPound registry key added to allow the pound sign to be substituted for an alternative ascii value on customer displays

### FIX
- If you had a VGA customer display configured and swapped skins then ICRTouch could lock up when entering sales mode
- Some combinations of user name/password would be rejected by DynDNS
- Using more than 24 characters on a discount key could result in ICRTouch crashing when the key is used
- Sending the keyboard file in Manager Mode didn't send the buttons shape or if it's an image
- If you have enforced amount tendered set on a finalise key and set to prompt with a numeric key pad, if you simply pressed the finalise key than it would error rather than pop up with the key pad
- The double height flag for order number printing per kp was being ignored
