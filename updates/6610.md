# ICRTouch v2/3.66.1 - 01/07/2016

__Version ID__: 6610
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Changes made to TOW and Webshop interface so that the terminals will continue to retry communicating with the service in the event of receiving and invalid access key message
- Added field "FROMSPLITSEAT" to ICR_GetClerkBuffer_Index()
- Printing a receipt from a paid seat now prints a full finalised receipt for that seat

### FIX
- Win CE versions running TOW could crash unexpectedly after sales
- If multiple mix and match tables were fired off at the same time then the discount applied could be less than it should've been
- Paying for a seat and then on returning to the split check dialog trying to immediately add items into the same seat would result in the display not being updated correctly
