### FIX
- Open check report didn't print the number line in journal 2 
- Starting a new check mid way through a sale would result in the consecutive number on the bill being 1 higher than it should be
- Using the new split check dialog with stay down clerks would result in the till gradually leaking clerk interrupt buffers
- Using RS232 ibutton readers configured for sign off at removal of ibutton could under some circumstances cause the till to stop updating the display for a small period of time 
- Transferring to tables on the floorplan that have the Force service charge setting could result in the setting being removed
- Large PLU Predictions would draw off the edge of the program mode screen
- If a customer transfer was done on the customer master and the terminal shut down not long after the program changes could be lost
- You couldn't print EFT report to an ip printer with some EFT types
- Calling ICR_Web_Reset() after using ICR_Web_Get() to retrieve a file from a web server using Etal could later result in instability or crashing of TouchPoint
