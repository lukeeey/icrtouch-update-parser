# ICRTouch v2/3.62.1 - 25/02/2014

__Version ID__: 6210
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### FIX
- Using the clerk change function with a clerk number higher than 128 gave undefined results
- Bills stored in the bills store would still show PLUs, Non Add keys, text messages and category shifts that were configured not to print
- Bills previewed on screen would show category shift keys
- Gift receipts set for consolidation still printed prices
- KP Category shift, category sorting and consolidation used together didn't work very well
- VNC debug output turned off
- Solved a small resource leak when using Etal command ICR_AwaitFile()
- Occasionally it may be possible that VNC clients didn't authenticate properly even though the correct password was entered
- If TouchPoint was part off the screen or minimized when a VNC client was connected that the displayed image may not be correct
- Number values with a maximum of 8 digits could be sent through the XML Socket
- If the receipt width was set greater than 40 characters then characters would be truncated off of the EJF2 and reports may not print into EJF2
- The points adjustment key when used to add points actually added double; only applies to TouchPoint 2014
- The points adjustment key would print on the journal as a monetary value rather than number of points
- PLU files larger than 32,000 would cause icrcomm.dll to crash when polling sales data (TouchPoint 2014 only)
- Changes made to Finalise, Transaction or Status Key text sent through the xml socket didn't get automatically changed on the keybaord
- If you were using the report store, TouchOffice Web and printed a journal report that was longer than 10,000 lines then the till could crash
- If you used the Etal function ICR_ProgramSendFile() in the middle of a sale then you could lose that sale
- You couldn't turn an 'off receipt' into an 'on receipt' when using the Etal event OnReceiptRequired()
