# ICRTouch v68.40 - 27/11/2018

__Version ID__: 6840
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- PLUS ITEM Status Key is now inhibited from being used on items that came from checks and are flagged to print to the kitchen or ticket printers

### FIX
- Floating a clerk that was in the middle of paying for a seat after having used the split check operation would result in the check being left locked in a busy state
- When the floor plan is configured to use check numbers, it was possible to erase the detail for a random check by using the print preview dialog on the check master, followed by physically printing the bill for a finalised table
- Under some circumstances when using stay down clerks configured with a different starting level than the standard reg level and making the final payment to a split check, it would be possible for the till to drawer the current menu level incorrectly
