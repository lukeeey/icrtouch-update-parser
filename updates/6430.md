# ICRTouch v2/3.64.3 - 7/1/2016

__Version ID__: 6430
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- HTML customer display no longer requires a socket password
- Updated the PNotify connection to match v2.66
- Days to payment code, hardware activation status, serial number and busy resets added to health check software
- Key stored for online stats is now refreshed if the stored licence number is changed
- Change made so that HDD serial numbers that are read in Win7 better match the same numbers read in XP etc

### FIX
- If you were on the floor plan and already had a table open, then attempted to open a new empty table the till would then error "Already have a table open".  At this point if you ok'd the message but stayed on the floor plan you could then float your clerk to another till whilst leaving the floor plan open on the original till. If you did this, then attempted to open a new table, again, on the original machine without first exiting the floor plan, this could then create a partially opened table with no cashier on it and no rolling on of the consecutive number
- Floating a clerk that is currently signed onto another till would result in a stub entry appearing in the journal for that clerk with a sale id of 0
- The PBAL/items printed in a funny order on the journal when using the Resume key to resume a suspended sale
- Under certain circumstances when busy resetting a check that is actually open, it would be possible to get a stub entry created in the check index file that was corrupt
