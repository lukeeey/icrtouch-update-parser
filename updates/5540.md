### FIX
- If a condiment item had a KP status, and no other items had printed to the KP at that point then the condiment item would be printed as per it's own KP status
- If an LPT printer went offline whilst ICRTouch was downloading a print job to it then ICRTouch would hang until the LPT printer came back online again
- If you set the "Allow customer not present?" flag when using YesPay it would error; Only tables can be used in hospitality mode. v2.55.3+ only
- Preset check text wasn't set when transfering to a new table
- The 'Thank you' message could get lost on rental codes

### NOTE
- A change to the way that sales data is stored internally means that putting this version in a live system with ICRTouch of different versions will mangle sales data when clerk sales are floated
