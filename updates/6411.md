## Release Notes
### MOD
- Change to Quantum X cash drawer so that when it's on COM5 the drawer 1/2 support are switched around

- A flag has been added to IDC items to denote that it was sold by weight
- Clerk added to <GETCHECKLIST>

### FIX
- Preset clerk sign on keys that had, unsettable, flag 2 set could under some circumstances artifact the wrong clerk name and the correct clerk name on the button press
- Occasionaly when the covers dialog was on the screen when doing a table transfer to a new table the text might magically change to read table number
- When you used the Plus Item key it didn't show on the customer display
- Compulsory check on finalise didn't work on Account Payment keys
- Compulsory check on kp items didn't take account of the 'remote use only' flag on KPs
