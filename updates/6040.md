# ICRTouch v2/3.604 - 14/02/2014

__Version ID__: 6040
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Cash sales done on PocketTouch now add the tax totals into the IDC file so that they're uploaded correctly to TouchOffice Web
- IDC Uploader now polls program changes immediately after polling program changes so that they can be rapidly downloaded if supplied in small chunks

### FIX
- If the system was configured for IPX networking, IPX wasn't installed and the new style splash screen was in use then TouchPoint would hang at startup
- On some hardware/os combinations PLU and Keyboard files wouldn't upload to TouchOffice Web
- You could delete merged tables on the floor plan which resulted in a random size table appear
- Exported table layouts to PocketTouch could include tables with a table number of 0
- An issue with the way that the TAK is stored that means that under some conditions it's possible that a terminal may always receive the response "invalid user name/password" when attempting to connect to our online services
