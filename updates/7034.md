# ICRTouch v70.34 - 05/09/2019

__Version ID__: 7034
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Various changes for Belgium
- When the "Corrected items go to reg buffer?" flag is set and you correct a discounted item the price of the item shown is now its net price rather then its original gross price
- All dialogs now support a 'FixedPos' attribute which prevents them from being dragged around the screen by the user
- Keyboard programming and Floorplan now also support the 'FixedPos' attribute which prevents them from being dragged around the screen by the user

### FIX
- The floor plan now validates the level configured when set to go to a default level as configuring this to be level 2,000,000 would crash the till when the floor plan key was pressed
- When auto creating new customers using the data entry dialog the telephone 2 flag operated both telephone 2 and 3
- Discount entries sent through the XML Socket interface were stored in the check and socket journal showing a +ve value
- Attempting to drag a dialog whose dimensions were configured to be the exact size of the display would result in a crash
- Price shift plu sent from XML socket were not flagged as price shift
- When configured for printing random codes on receipts an incorrect code would be printed if the PLU record number was greater than 32,000
- It was possible for a licenced till to crash when the OS returned no serial number for a HDD. This was seen on TouchPoint when running in a VM
- When using ICR_Web_Get() if you had a : in the query string and no port specified then TouchPoint would fail to extract the correct hostname from the URL
- Vouchers printed from TouchPoint would always include a currency symbol regardless of which type of voucher they were
- The flag 'Covers is 1 when no covers entered' had no effect when opening tables from PocketTouch
