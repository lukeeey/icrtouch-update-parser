### FIX
- Finalise key type CASH2 still made use of the 'prompt for cashback?' flag from keytype CASH even though it wasn't there
- The socket journal would stop printing once the output buffer was full
- Receipts printed from remote devices such as PocketTouch and TouchTakeaway would print the training mode character if the cashier signed onto the till at the time was a trainee
- The plus amount key needed the non-existent flag 'Allow preset overide' from the minus amount key to be set to pop up with a dialog when pressed
- It was occasionally possible to have PocketTouch tickets appear in reports uploaded to TOW
- Receipt lines uploaded to TOW didn't have the correct file number stored against them
- You could still do a Z with "No Z with active clerk" if the clerk you had signed on had something stored in the suspend buffer
- Under certain rare circumstances it was possible that if you had more than one ICRTouch web service configured that one of them may stop communicating to the servers requiring a restart to get them going again
- ICR_WebPost() would never return a result if a network level error was encountered
