# ICRTouch v2/3.561 - 22/7/2011

__Version ID__: 5613
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- XML Socket - Implemented program send and recieve of the clerk detail file
- XML Socket - Normalised the record number when using program send and recieve of the time zone detail link file
- Added the current time to mode change entries in the journal
- Added an overview of program mode changes to the journal and an entry that indicates that the technician code has been used to sign on
- Correctly validates the day of month when entering a date in PGM3
- Stopped the 'No Disk' error popping up in the Win32 version if a multi type usb camera card reader was connected to the system

### FIX
- If you had Â£ signs as the first character of a plu's text then you could no longer search products by name on the seach dialog
- When PocketTouch 2 opened a check, internally all the plu's would have a record number of 1 - to date this doesn't actually cause any problems
- You couldn't range program the expiry date of customers in program mode
- A problem with the IDC file that meant that some of the detail items from sales could be left duplicated in the file.  This only affects software that makes use of the IDC file, rather than the day to day running of the till
