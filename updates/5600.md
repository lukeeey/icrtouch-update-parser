### FIX
- Some strangeness when Escaping from Ext product group items that may even result in a crash - Earlier Etal versions only
- Discount % [all] mix and match tables took the % from the item total, as opposed to the total % from each item which meant if items we sold with odd prices then the dept/net totals could be out.  Note this may affect the way that the discount is given on some mix and match tables so please check these
- PNG & GIF support didn't work when the primary display was set for 16 bit colour
- Using customer loyalty set for discounts, if you had no discount accrued in the sale the Discount Tl fixed total quantity would still increment by 1
- Printing a List PLU report in PGM6 for List PLU tables that had 50 items in could print some random characters on the 50th item
- Defering items in Set Menus that had condiments attached to them would result in the condiment item being registered at the end of the current sale
- Correcting a Set Menu parent item didn't automatically correct all the items below it
- Enforced amount tender compulsion removed from negative sales
- KP Now key only worked on kp 1
- Changes made to the way that change is stored on the finalise key total when it's given in the sub currency or vice versa
- If you had the report printer set to print to a device connected to terminal id 10, then single inline reports wouldn't do anything
