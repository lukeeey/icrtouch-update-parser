# ICRTouch v2/3.66.5 - 31/07/2017

__Version ID__: 6651
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Check device for error messages sent to the local EFT app now show in the 2nd line of the dialog, rather than the title
- Sales finalised that were made by splitting some items out of a check now add to the paid check total
- X and Z Counters now appear in the report store
- Changes made to correctly support Weight PLU quantities through the XML Socket

### FIX
- Set menu items when printed on a bill weren't indented
- 0 value set menu items when printed on a bill had their price printed
- Discounting PLU when the system was set to not NET Totalizing would still alter the internal NET price of the PLU, which could have an effect if that item was later corrected as it would be discounted by its discounted price
- Having items on a dept or group report with totals large enough to need more than 1 line to print combined with having the system configured to print the sales ratio would crash the till when that report was run
- It was possible under some rare conditions to have an odd amount shown on the dept report that couldn't be removed by Z reset
