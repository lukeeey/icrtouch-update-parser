## Release Notes
### FIX
- Using the new receipt store if a receipt was stored just as the minute changed it might be possible that you cannot open it again as the file and index could have different times
- The View Receipt Store key could be used without a clerk signed on
- The machine number and clerk number were shown swapped in the view receipt store list
- If you entered something crazy into a post code when setting up a new customer it finished editing the customer
