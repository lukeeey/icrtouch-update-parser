## Release Notes
### MOD
- Correctly prints the Euro character on the internal printer on a Compak when running WinCE
- Support added for HTML emails in Etal
- Changes made to the FTP to support background uploading and better completion messages
- Added the correct internal file and record number for customer phone numbers on receipt printing
- The bill print buttons on the new style floor plan now log the clerk off correctly as it did with the old style floor plan
- Added support to the XML socket for sales extraction of file 401 - PLU Stock

### FIX
- Under some circumstances it's possible for the on screen dialogs to stop receiving input from an external keyboard
- It's possible when viewing a paid bill that a line of strange characters can appear at the very bottom
- In program 4 by using up some of the undo buffer and then filling it up again it was possible to crash the software
- Using points with selective itemisers, if you started the points at selective itemisers 3 or 4 only, then it would behave a bit strange
- If service charge is set to add to Net Sales and the end of sale pop up total window was used then the total shown would contain double the service charge
- When using the new sytle floor plan some of the error messages like "Check Busy" would throw an error tone but show no message
- If you were using kp tickets configured for compressed printing and had sound buzzer at order turned on then the buzzer wouldn't be sounded
- Using massive strings with some functions in Etal could result in some instability issues
