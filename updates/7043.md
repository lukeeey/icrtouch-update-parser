# ICRTouch v70.43 - 12/02/2020

__Version ID__: 7043
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Sale total rounding sent as payment to Belgium FDM

### FIX
- Under rare circumstances with the price level schedular configured to shift a level at 23:59 it may be possible for it to use a scheduled change 24 hours early
- Using 2 x ICR_File_OpenPipe() commands, one immediately after the other could result in crashing TouchPoint
- The XML command <GETCHECKLIST> could become unstable if the system has more than 200 open checks/tables
- Service charge applied remotely used the gross item value rather than the net
- When the search dialog was being used with the PLU Group Search button, and the direct entry for option windows was selected then the wrong PLU may be selected when you select an item
- The same report run within the same minute would result in only the second instance of it being stored in the report store
- ICR_SetNextDialogInput() followed by ICR_GetAlphaDialog() without a max length setting could crash the till
