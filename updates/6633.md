# ICRTouch v2/3.66.3 - 14/12/2016

__Version ID__: 6633
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Added support for tables finalised using PocketTouch to push Remote NET Sales and Tax Totals into TOW

### FIX
- It is possible that if changes are made to the check file by remote devices like PocketTouch and a terminal is power cycled without any other changes made to the check file that those changes could get lost
- If webshop orders were set to print to an IP Printer and the same IP printer was in use for a long period of time whilst the order was being processed, for example printing a report, then it was possible that the order may end up repeated in the till system
