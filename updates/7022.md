# ICRTouch v70.22 - 29/05/2019

__Version ID__: 7022
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Price change keys no longer print on Gift Receipts
- When printing customer transaction history in any mode that is not X Mode, you are now only presented with the option for all customers and all transaction history so as not to cause confusion about what would end up being reset
- Prompt for Eat In / Take Out at sign on changed to only prompt when in Reg or RF mode
- Stopped Mix and Match lines from being added into the receipt buffer when they are 0 value
- Added the registry setting NoFingerPrints which stops TouchPoint from initialising its internal finger print support

### FIX
- Using finger print functions could crash the till if finger prints were not installed
- Deposits taken using the reservation module would not be stored in the IDC data store and so would not be uploaded to TOW
