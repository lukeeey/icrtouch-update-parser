__Version ID__: 6050
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Better status messages shown in PGM3 when unable to connect to icrtouch-connect.com for the IDC Uploader, where before the status would read 'Not Started'

### FIX
- Euro chacter didn't work correctly with some XML interfaces, including TouchOffice Web
- Under some circumstances the data entry dialog may have the same field name repeated over in the first column
- If you supplied the Etal function ICR_AwaitFile with a 0 timeout then it wouldn't actually check to see if the file was there or not
- If you opened a new table on the floor plan then went back immediately into the floor plan and tried to print a bill for it you would lock the table as busy
- If you force kill a PocketTouch device whilst it's being asked a question like number of covers then the CPU usage on the till can be left in an elevated state
