# ICRTouch v2/3.561 - 3/6/2011

__Version ID__: 5611
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Etal - Added the field 'MULTIPLIER' to the table returned from ICR_GetClerkBuffer_Index().  This is integer value with 3 assumed dp, eg 3000 represents 3.000 x

### FIX
- When using YesPay under WinXP - if cash back amounts were entered on the YesPay dialog as opposed to ICRTouch then the cash back amount wouldn't be shown on the ICRTouch receipt or included in the end of day reports
- Etal - Fixed a problem whereby if in a script the Etal engine throws an error in a function that expect a return value, eg BeforeKeyPress() then ICRTouch would throw up a Windows RunTime error dialog
