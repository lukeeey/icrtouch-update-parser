# ICRTouch v76.11 - 02/11/2022

__Version ID__: 7611
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Improvements to the TCP Micros 4700 emulation
- Change made to the XML Parser to prevent it from converting broken UTF-8 bytes that represent a value of less than 128 into a unicode numeric character entity
- Changes made so that if checks are removed whilst a clerk has them open - eg busy reset and paid - then spurious entries wont be created in the check file when the clerk is later found

### FIX
- Double sized characters rendered in some of the display dialogs may inherit their size from a different dialog
- It is possible that TouchPoint may attempt to upload invalid program data file types to TOW
- Price shifts didn't carry into List PLU when being used in the new keyboard mode
