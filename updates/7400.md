### FIX
- Webshop sales containing more than around 400 items could crash TouchPoint
- Product texts sent to the Webshop interface would be truncated at 25 bytes/characters
- Mix and Match adjustments made by PocketTouch did not record in the till's sales totals
- The "do not add to total in drawer" flag in fixed totaliser wasn't respected for sales made remotely
- Using an iButton on fingerprint when the Cashback dialog was on screen during an EFT operation would leave TouchPoint in a position where the dialog was stuck flickering on the screen
- It was possible to crash TouchPoint when certain things were put into message in the kitchen in ByTable
- The tax breakdown may be missing the end characters on a finalised bill, applies to v73.XX only
- When using TTU as the customer master, redeeming points in a sale multiple times would result in too many points being redeemed off of the customer account
- Bills printed from the handheld for sales finalised on the handheld did not print the service charge line
- Improvements to the way that items registered from List PLU windows greater than 250 are item corrected
- Using alpha check numbers and auto new checks from PocketTouch or Webshop sales would result in a non-alpha auto new check number being created
- Using the XML Socket it was possible to send down conflicting finalisation types
- The interface to the HTML customer display stopped working in v73.16
- When using the HTML display, for many operations the line 2 value would appear on line 1
- PocketTouch and Webshop sales incorrectly uploaded the netsaletotal in the IDC header when the sale was stored to a check
