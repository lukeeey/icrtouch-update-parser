### FIX
- Qty on mix and match total when linked to a clerk detail or time zone report out by a factor of 100
- When printing bills from PocketTouch it used the training setting for the clerk that is currently signed onto the till. This has now been changed to use the clerk that was used to open the check, which is slightly inconsistent with the way that the till works, but ok otherwise
- Under some circumstances it might be possible for the till to crash when performing a clocking in/out operation and it's configured to print a stub ticket 
- The current bill number when doing a dutch bill print would always be shown as total number of bills plus 1
