## Release Notes
### FIX
- Using a combination of Payment Sense Table Payments, tax settings and leaving clerks signed onto the check master without starting a sale, it's possible to end up with sales with a sale id of 0 that may not be uploaded to TOW
- It was only possible to store the first 11 characters of check text in PGM2
- If the internal button coordinates of the keyboard that you were on were significantly different from the one that you might end up on after having signed on to the till, then some of the buttons on the new keyboard level may not draw or be accessible without a menu level shift
