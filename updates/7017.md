__Version ID__: 7017
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### FIX
- When using the data entry dialog, if you had a stored line that was larger than 25 characters and you made changes to characters after the 25th character then the display of line might not be updated until another line was edited
- When using vouchers in refund mode, unpredictable results could be obtained
- When using a cash keytype configured for "Cashback", if you swiped a magnetic card through the dialog then the system would create an entry of -1 for the cash back amount
- A combination of the "RS232 iButton reader" setting in IO Parameter, WinXP, the sign off at removal of iButton flag and a change of menu level before removing the iButton to sign off, could result in the main display ceasing to update requiring a restart
