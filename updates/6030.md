__Version ID__: 6030
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Etal function ICR_GetNumberDialog() now accepts number kind type 3 - String
- The first polling for the webshop interface is now 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes
- Internal Dynamic DNS integration added

### FIX
- If you set the "Service Charge calcs on Subtotal" flag you would lose access to some of the other service charge flags inc the flag you'd just set!
- If you had an empty ICRTouch Connect Access Key, IDC Uploader was turned on and no internet connection then TouchPoint would crash after 5 minutes of running
- When using Mix and Match tables with straight discount %, net totalising, if multiple instances of the same table were triggered after the subtotal key then the total could be incorrect
