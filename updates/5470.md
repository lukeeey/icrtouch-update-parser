# ICRTouch v2/3.547 - 2/3/2011

__Version ID__: 5470
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- The age verification dialog now locks the keyboard and beeps immediately prior to be shown so that no more bar codes can be scanned
- Some small changes made to better support the way that journal 2 is flushed to disk on slower disks

### FIX
- If you used the Non Turnover flag in conjunction with stay down clerks then only the first sale registered would be non turnover
- The reason table sales totals didn't persist correctly
- If you used mix and match type 1, process mix and match after subtotal set and used the same mix and match table multiple times in a sale then strange things would happen to the items in the reg buffer
- The Change Clerk key could be used to sign clerks on into modes that they weren't allowed access to
