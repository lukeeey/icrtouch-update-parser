# ICRTouch v2/3.543 - 23/6/2009

__Version ID__: 5430
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Buffer size of the on-screen print dialog has now been increased from 2,000 lines to 20,000 lines
- LPT printer support
For WinCE this will require a version of WinCE that supports LPT ports {v1.70+}
- Changes to the Update Server:
Added the ability to download seperate BETA updates
Added the ability to alter the internal version id in order to force an update
- J2 650 cash drawer
- Better handling of check detail file when full
In so much that checks retrieved with items outside the check detail limit will contain white space, as opposed to seemingly random items as previously was the case

### FIX
- Using a Discount Amount key configured for "Restrict to one use per sale" on a sale with more than about 150 items in it would result in ICRTouch locking up
- If a report that was more than 2,000 lines was printed to the on-screen print dialog then ICRTouch would crash
- The line "Local to EURO(sub) exchange rate" was missing from the language file
- In the WinXP version you could no longer edit the time zone detail links {v2.54.0+}
- Using Discount keys with the ICRTouch hotel posting spec would result in a crash when the post was done {v2.54.1+}
- Reports printed to a serial printer connected to a remote machine that were longer than 500 lines could have their tops chopped off
