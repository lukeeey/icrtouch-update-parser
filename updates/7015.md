# ICRTouch v70.15 - 01/03/2019

__Version ID__: 7015
<br>__Min Version ID__: 5411

## Release Notes
### MOD
- Changes made to allow TouchPoint to work with EFT apps when TouchPoint has been started with elevated privileges, but the EFT app hasn't

### FIX
- Reverted an earlier change to the way that till handles no covers being entered as it created an issue where COVERS 1 would print on the receipt in some configurations
- Dept or PLU Group names for groups over 128 didn't print correctly on bills or receipts when set to sort by dept or group
- Rebuild receipt when set to always would print the tax table on receipts for stored tables if the first finalise key was configured to print tax
- Plus item key didn't add to tax totals, TouchPoint 2019 only
- When the system was configured to rebuild the receipt from the registration buffer, the order info and tax lines would appear twice in the journal
- If receipt store folder is marked as read only or doesn't have sufficient write permissions, and the receipt store is turned on then the till could crash each time it does a sale
